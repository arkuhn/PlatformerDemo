# PlatformerDemo
I've been playing games since before I can remember and I always said game design would be a hobby of mine. Heres a first crack at learning some basics.
## Installation
Pull the code and run the game class.
## Usage
There are on screen instructions. So far, arrow keys to move. F for fire, E for scratch, H for healing, D for dash, W to jump.
## History
The resources and core game driver were made via the help of youtube(ForeignGuyMike) but I've since been modifying everything from sprites to core mechanics. Skills are being created, consumables, and more.
##TODO
I'd like to make an abstract item class and branch out past consumables. Eventually, an inventory will be added.
